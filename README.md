# Enhanced Fraud Detection: A comparative study of Ensemble Learning, Machine Learning and Retrieval Augmented Generation

## Overview

This repository has one main notebook file [View the Notebook](code_files/main.ipynb)
All code related to data loading, pre-processing, EDA, Feature engineering, Training and Testing is included in this. Code is structured in object oriented way using classes and functions to maintain a proper structure and reduce redundancy.

Code Structure is as below
* Environment Setup
    - sdasdas
* Data Ingestion
* Data Pre-processing
* Explorative Data Analysis (EDA)
* Feature Engineering
* Random Forest Classifier Model
* Neural Network Model
* Retrieval Augmented Generation

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
* Python 3.x
* Relevant Python libraries as listed in [View Requirements](code_files/requirements.txt)

### Special Notes
* For the experiments involved with Open AI embeddings, add a authentic Open AI key to execute. I have excluded the key from code for security purposes.
